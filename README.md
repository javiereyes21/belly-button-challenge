# Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard focused on microbiome data. The dashboard uses an interactive interface to allow users to select samples and explore data on bacterial cultures. By selecting a sample, users can view metadata about the sample, a bubble chart showing the bacterial cultures present, and a bar chart of the top 10 bacterial cultures.

The project was built as part of a data visualization module in a data analytics program.
